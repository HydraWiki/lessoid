;     MediaWiki Shim for use with LESSoid

; NOTICE: This file is for the configuration of the LESSoid shim
; for MediaWiki. Configuration for the actual LESSoid service can
; be located in config.json in the LESSoid service directory.

; This file is provided as the default settings. It is in your best
; interest to not modify this file, but instead to override its settings
; by creating a config.ini file and placing the settings below in it.

; Override Default Node.js calling path when calling lessc from the Command Line
; By default, lessc will be directly. For most systems this will be fine,
; but we have run into issues with the shebang used by lessc not properly
; finding nodejs (especially debian based systems). If you run into any issues
; we suggest setting this to the full path of your node executable!
;
; Example:
; node_override = "/usr/bin/node"

node_override = false;
